# Workflow Defaults Contract

This document defines the shared repo-level defaults contract for
`workflow-orchestration`. It gives repositories one narrow place to declare
baseline workflow behavior without editing individual skill prompts.

## Purpose

Use workflow defaults to declare repo-level policy for:

- durable artifact sinks;
- preferred review mode;
- automation guardrails;
- knowledge-capture behavior;
- publish defaults.

The contract is intentionally small. It defines defaults and override rules, not
the full behavior of each workflow.

## Canonical file identity

For milestone `1.6.0`, the defaults file is discovered at one canonical
root-relative path:

```text
.workflow-orchestration/defaults.json
```

There is no multi-path lookup order in this phase. A missing file means the
repository has not declared shared workflow defaults, so each workflow falls
back to its documented local behavior.

## File format and version marker

The defaults file is machine-readable JSON:

```json
{
  "schema-version": "1.0",
  "artifact-sinks": {
    "planning": "docs/",
    "track-reports": "docs/",
    "readiness-reports": "docs/",
    "publish-summaries": "docs/",
    "knowledge": "docs/knowledge/"
  },
  "review": {
    "mode": "interactive"
  },
  "automation": {
    "progression": "manual",
    "stop-for-human": ["publish", "merge", "release"]
  },
  "knowledge": {
    "capture": "explicit",
    "lookup": "advisory"
  },
  "publish": {
    "target-branch": "main",
    "draft-pr": false
  }
}
```

`schema-version` is required. All other keys are optional and may be partially
specified.

## Key groups

### `artifact-sinks`

Maps workflow artifact categories to their default durable sink.

Supported keys in this phase:

- `planning`
- `track-reports`
- `readiness-reports`
- `publish-summaries`
- `knowledge`

Each value is a root-relative path string. Directory values are normalized by
the owning workflow using that workflow's existing artifact template and file
naming convention. The contract does **not** require one global directory
taxonomy; it only gives the repository a shared default starting point.

If a sink key is missing, the workflow falls back to its skill-local documented
sink behavior. For example, `knowledge-compound` may still require an explicit
sink when no repo default is configured.

### `review`

Defines repo-level review preferences shared by review-shaped workflows.

Supported keys in this phase:

- `mode`: `interactive` | `headless`

If omitted, review workflows use their existing documented mode selection and
developer prompts.

### `automation`

Defines whether workflows stay manual or may advance with bounded automation.

Supported keys in this phase:

- `progression`: `manual` | `guided` | `auto`
- `stop-for-human`: array of lifecycle boundaries that must never advance
  without explicit human confirmation

Phase `1.6.0` documents these values as guardrails only. They do not grant
unsafe implicit autonomy to any workflow.

### `knowledge`

Defines knowledge-capture defaults that remain advisory rather than mandatory.

Supported keys in this phase:

- `capture`: `explicit` | `suggested`
- `lookup`: `advisory`

This group must not impose a mandatory taxonomy. A repository may define a
default sink through `artifact-sinks.knowledge`, but individual invocations may
still override it or require explicit confirmation when the workflow needs one.

### `publish`

Defines repo-level publication defaults.

Supported keys in this phase:

- `target-branch`: default PR base branch
- `draft-pr`: boolean default for PR creation

If omitted, publish workflows fall back to the target branch inferred from the
repo or developer input, and they use the workflow-local default PR behavior.

## Override precedence

When a workflow resolves a value, use this precedence order:

1. explicit developer input for the current invocation;
2. continuation-specific context already locked into the active workflow state,
   but only when the workflow is explicitly resuming that same lifecycle;
3. `.workflow-orchestration/defaults.json`;
4. the workflow's documented local fallback behavior.

Workflows must consume only the keys relevant to them. Missing keys do not make
the whole config invalid.

## Fallback behavior

- Missing defaults file: continue normally with workflow-local defaults.
- Missing key group: continue normally for that concern.
- Missing individual key: use the fallback for just that key.
- Partial config: use the configured keys and fall back for the rest.
- Unknown keys: ignore them without failing the workflow.

## Artifact sink normalization rules

The defaults file records shared sink intent, not one fixed repository layout.

Normalization rules:

1. a directory path such as `docs/` means "write the workflow's normal artifact
   file into this directory";
2. a file path means "use this exact durable sink" when the artifact shape is
   singular for that workflow;
3. the owning workflow still chooses the final filename when the sink value is a
   directory;
4. workflows may reject a sink that conflicts with their own artifact contract,
   but they must surface that rejection explicitly and fall back rather than
   silently dropping output.

## Invalid-config handling boundaries

Malformed or unsupported config must not create silent success-shaped behavior.

- If the file cannot be parsed as JSON, treat the whole defaults file as
  unavailable for that invocation and fall back to workflow-local behavior.
- If `schema-version` is missing or unsupported, treat the whole file as
  unavailable and do not auto-progress from it.
- If a known key has the wrong type, ignore that key only, record the mismatch
  in the workflow's durable artifact when practical, and fall back for that key.
- Do not coerce complex values silently.
- Unknown keys are ignored.

The workflow may continue when defaults are invalid, but only in the same safe
mode it would use if the file were absent.

## Ownership

The repository owns the defaults file. Workflow skills read it when present;
they do not invent or rewrite the file during normal execution in this phase.

## Relationship to durable workflow state

Workflow defaults are static repo policy. Durable workflow state records the
current lifecycle position of a specific workflow run. They are related, but
they are not the same artifact and must not be merged.
