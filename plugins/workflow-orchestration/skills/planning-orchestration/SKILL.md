description: Create a durable implementation plan with scout discovery, reviewer critique, and optional SDD orchestration.
---

## Purpose

Use this skill when a developer wants a disciplined planning workflow before implementation, especially for feature-shaped work that may need specification, planning, task generation, or explicit execution handoff.

Persistent team, squad, or fleet-style long-lived orchestration is out of scope for this skill. Use a separate orchestration layer if persistent coordination is needed.

This skill is for planning and orchestration, not direct implementation. It may optionally compose with `sdd-workflow`, but it must fall back cleanly when SDD is unavailable.

## When to Use It

Activate when the developer asks for things like:

- "plan this feature"
- "turn this idea into a spec and tasks"
- "figure out whether this needs SDD"
- "prepare an implementation plan before we code"

Use a lighter path or skip this skill when the work is already narrow and fully scoped, such as a single-file bug fix or a straightforward review follow-up.

## Project-Specific Inputs

Before you start, identify:

- the feature or change request to plan;
- the active repository and relevant code areas;
- whether the task is feature-shaped enough to warrant SDD;
- the repository's validation commands;
- where durable planning artifacts should live;
- whether `sdd-workflow` is available in the current runtime;
- whether the repository permits `.sdd/` planning workspaces or expects another temporary planning sink.

## Default Roles

Use separate roles for:

- a **scout** that discovers factual context;
- a **planner** that produces or orchestrates the plan;
- a **reviewer** that critiques the resulting plan.

All roles may receive the discovery brief as factual context — file lists, task boundaries, validation commands, and known dependencies. Do not pass one role's conclusions or assessments to another; the reviewer must form an independent judgment from the plan artifact itself.

### Model Selection

Resolve the active model for each role using this priority chain:

1. **Project config**
   - Copilot CLI: `.copilot/models.yaml`
   - Claude Code: `.claude/models.yaml`
2. **Session cache**
3. **Baked-in defaults**

#### Config file format

```yaml
planner: <model-name>
reviewer: <model-name>
scout: <model-name>
```

See `docs/models-config-template.md` for ready-to-copy runtime templates.

#### Default models

| Runtime       | Role    | Default model      |
|---------------|---------|--------------------|
| Copilot CLI   | Planner | `claude-opus-4.6`  |
| Copilot CLI   | Reviewer| `gpt-5.4`          |
| Copilot CLI   | Scout   | `claude-haiku-4.5` |
| Claude Code   | Planner | `claude-opus-4.6`  |
| Claude Code   | Reviewer| `claude-opus-4.6`  |
| Claude Code   | Scout   | `claude-haiku-4.5` |

## Core Rules

### 1. Plan only as much as the task shape requires

Do not run a heavy planning workflow for a narrow, fully scoped change. Use scout discovery to decide whether the request needs:

- full SDD-backed planning;
- lightweight fallback planning; or
- no separate planning at all.

### 2. Use one factual brief, not repeated discovery

Create one discovery brief per planning session when possible. The brief should capture shared facts, not conclusions:

- relevant files;
- validation commands;
- scope boundaries;
- known dependencies;
- open questions.

### 3. Prefer SDD when it materially helps

If `sdd-workflow` is available and the task is feature-shaped, the planner may orchestrate:

- `/sdd-workflow:sdd.specify`
- `/sdd-workflow:sdd.plan`
- `/sdd-workflow:sdd.tasks`

If SDD is unavailable or overkill for the task, use the fallback planning flow instead.

### 4. A durable planning artifact is mandatory

The planning session is not complete until one durable planning artifact or planning summary has been produced. Chat-only planning is not sufficient.

### 5. Rescue before abandonment

If discovery, planning, or review stalls:

1. narrow the task shape;
2. reduce context;
3. switch from SDD-backed mode to fallback mode if needed;
4. escalate to the developer only after rescue fails.

## Workflow

### 1. Run discovery (or skip it)

Before delegating to expensive planning or review work, run one lightweight discovery pass using the **scout** model.

The scout MUST produce a short factual brief covering:

- task summary;
- task shape;
- relevant files;
- validation commands;
- task boundaries;
- known dependencies;
- whether `sdd-workflow` appears available.

Use the discovery brief template from `docs/workflow-artifact-templates.md`.

**Skip condition**: Skip discovery only when the request is already narrow and fully scoped. If skipped, record the skip reason in the brief.

### 2. Choose the planning mode

Based on the brief, the planner chooses one of these modes:

1. **SDD-backed planning** — when the work is feature-shaped and `sdd-workflow` is available.
2. **Fallback planning** — when SDD is unavailable, incomplete, or unnecessary.
3. **No-separate-planning** — when the work should go directly to implementation or review resolution.

Record the chosen mode and rationale in the planning artifact.

### 3. Produce the draft plan

If using **SDD-backed planning**, orchestrate:

1. `/sdd-workflow:sdd.specify`
2. `/sdd-workflow:sdd.plan`
3. `/sdd-workflow:sdd.tasks`

Then normalize those outputs into one planning summary that captures:

- scope;
- validation;
- sequencing;
- recommended next action.

If using **fallback planning**, produce the same information directly without SDD.

### 4. Review the plan

Send the plan artifact to a separate reviewer and ask for only substantive issues:

- scope drift;
- missing constraints;
- weak dependency ordering;
- missing validation strategy;
- unclear handoff to execution.

#### Bounded review resend loop

If the reviewer finds substantive issues:

1. return only the unresolved planning issues to the planner;
2. revise the plan without broadening scope unnecessarily;
3. re-review the revised artifact.

Allow at most **2 resend attempts**. If the plan still does not converge after the second resend, escalate to the developer or stop the planning session.

#### Rescue policy for stalled planning

If planning stalls — discovery remains unclear, SDD orchestration fails, or review churn continues without convergence:

1. capture the blocker in the durable planning artifact;
2. narrow the task or move to fallback mode;
3. retry once with the smaller scope;
4. if rescue fails, escalate to the developer with the unresolved questions.

### 5. Publish the planning artifact and hand off

Before stopping, publish one durable planning artifact or summary that records:

1. the chosen planning mode;
2. scope and out-of-scope boundaries;
3. relevant files and validation commands;
4. sequencing or dependency notes;
5. unresolved questions;
6. recommended next action;
7. workflow outcome measures.

The artifact MUST use a repository-appropriate durable sink — for example, a committed document, PR description, issue comment, or task tracker entry.

When appropriate, recommend the next workflow explicitly:

- `/workflow-orchestration:parallel-implementation-loop`
- direct implementation
- more planning or clarification

## Required Gates

A planning session is not complete until:

- a factual brief was created or a skip reason was recorded;
- the chosen planning mode was justified;
- the resulting plan was reviewed for substantive gaps;
- review found no unresolved substantive planning issues or the remaining issues were explicitly escalated;
- a durable planning artifact or planning summary was produced.

## Stop Conditions

- the task is too ambiguous to bound safely;
- required repository inputs remain unknown after rescue;
- SDD orchestration fails and fallback planning also cannot produce a coherent plan;
- review or planning churn continues without convergence;
- the developer asks to stop.

Before stopping because a planning loop stalled, always attempt rescue first: narrow scope, reduce context, or switch from SDD-backed planning to fallback mode.

## Example Planning Summary

```text
Task summary: Add a planning skill and umbrella marketplace layout
Planning mode: fallback planning
Relevant files: plugin.json, .github/plugin/marketplace.json, skills/planning-orchestration/SKILL.md
Validation commands: npm test, npm run validate:runtime
Task boundaries: In scope = plugin layout, planning skill, marketplace metadata; out of scope = persistent orchestration service
Dependencies: marketplace naming decision complete
Recommended next action: invoke /workflow-orchestration:parallel-implementation-loop for implementation
Unresolved questions:
- Whether to keep the current plugin name during the first migration phase
Workflow outcome measures:
- discovery-reuse: yes
- rescue-attempts: 0
```
