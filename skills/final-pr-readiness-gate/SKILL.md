description: Run a final readiness pass on a stable branch or pull request diff using structured checks plus a final whole-diff review.
---

## Purpose

Use this skill when a branch or pull request diff is finally stable and you want one last high-signal readiness pass before asking for human review.

This is a final integrated gate, not an inline coding step.

## When to Use It

Activate when the developer asks for things like:

- "run the final PR readiness pass"
- "check whether this branch is ready for review"
- "do a final integrated review"
- "give me a clear ready or not-ready verdict"

## Project-Specific Inputs

Before you start, identify:

- the stable review surface;
- the repository's target branch or comparison baseline;
- the repository's real validation commands;
- any available structured checker for code-bearing diffs;
- whether the current diff is code-bearing, docs-only, or config-only.

## Default Roles

Use:

- an optional **scout** for pre-slicing large diffs and preparing factual context;
- an optional **structured checker** for code-bearing diffs;
- a separate **final reviewer** for whole-diff judgment.

If no structured checker exists, continue with the final reviewer only. If the diff is small or focused, skip the scout and proceed directly.

### Escalation: Fleet / Agent Team Mode

If the active runtime offers a higher-cost orchestration mode such as a Fleet command or Claude Code agent teams, keep it optional and reserve it for unusually large or high-risk final review surfaces.

In most cases, one structured checker and one final reviewer are enough. Before escalating, explain the expected benefit and ask the developer whether they want the extra token cost.

Escalate only when:

1. the integrated diff is large enough that one reviewer would be noisy or shallow;
2. multiple specialized audit roles would materially improve the final judgment;
3. the review surface is already stable enough to coordinate as a team;
4. the developer explicitly opts in.

If team mode is approved, keep one final reviewer responsible for the single readiness verdict so the outcome does not fragment across agents.

### Model Selection

Resolve the active model for each role using this priority chain:

1. **Project config** — look for the runtime-specific config file in the current project root:
   - Copilot CLI: `.copilot/models.yaml`
   - Claude Code: `.claude/models.yaml`

   These are plain YAML files (no markdown, no fenced blocks). Read the `structured-check`, `final-reviewer`, and `scout` keys directly. If a key is absent, fall back to the baked-in default for that role — do not re-prompt for a key that is missing.

2. **Session cache** — if models were already confirmed earlier in this session, reuse them without asking again.
3. **Baked-in defaults** — if neither config file nor session cache exists, show the defaults below, ask the user to confirm or override them once, then cache the answer for the rest of the session.

#### Config file format

The config files are plain YAML (not markdown). Create the file for the active runtime and set only the keys you want to override — absent keys fall back to the baked-in defaults. The keys for this skill are:

```yaml
structured-check: <model-name>
final-reviewer: <model-name>
scout: <model-name>
```

See `docs/models-config-template.md` in this plugin for ready-to-copy templates for both runtimes.

#### Default models

| Runtime       | Role             | Default model       |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Copilot CLI   | Structured check | `gpt-5.4`           |
| Copilot CLI   | Final reviewer   | `gpt-5.4`           |
| Copilot CLI   | Scout            | `claude-haiku-4.5`  |
| Claude Code   | Structured check | `claude-opus-4.6`   |
| Claude Code   | Final reviewer   | `claude-opus-4.6`   |
| Claude Code   | Scout            | `claude-haiku-4.5`  |

## Preconditions

Before invoking this skill:

- the intended changes are already integrated;
- the branch or diff is stable enough to review as a whole;
- obvious validation failures have already been addressed.

If the diff is still moving significantly, stabilize it first.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish the stable review surface

Before running the final gate:

1. confirm the active branch and review target;
2. verify the intended changes are already integrated;
3. identify the final review surface:
   - preferably the pull request diff against the target branch;
   - otherwise the stable branch diff against the agreed baseline.

Evaluate the integrated result, not a partial local slice.

#### Pre-slicer discovery

Before proceeding to structured checks, run a fast scout pass to prepare the review surface for efficient downstream processing:

1. if the review surface was already established by a preceding workflow (such as `parallel-implementation-loop` or `pr-review-resolution-loop`), reuse it directly instead of rediscovering;
2. identify the diff structure: affected modules, file categories (code, tests, config, docs), and approximate size;
3. note high-risk or cross-cutting modules for prioritization during structured checks;
4. produce a discovery brief per `docs/workflow-artifact-templates.md` with at least: task shape, relevant files, comparison baseline, and validation commands.

Skip the scout pass when the diff is small or focused enough that a single reviewer can process it without pre-slicing — for example, fewer than roughly ten files in a single coherent module.

### 2. Decide whether a structured checker applies

If the stable diff is:

- code-bearing — run the structured checker if one exists;
- docs-only or config-only — skip structured code checks and continue with the final reviewer.

Do not force code-only tooling onto a non-code diff.

When multiple checker options exist, prefer the most semantic one available:

1. repository-specific structured reviewers or MCP-backed analyzers;
2. language-aware tooling such as LSP-backed or AST-aware checks;
3. text-only grep-style checks as a fallback.

### 3. Run structured checks in report-only mode

When a structured checker applies:

1. scope it to the stable integrated diff;
2. keep it report-only;
3. collect findings without automatically changing files;
4. if Fleet or agent-team mode is in use, require one aggregated finding summary before the final reviewer starts.

If the diff is large enough that a single pass becomes noisy, split the review into
coherent slices first and preserve one final whole-diff judgment at the end.

Focus on:

- security issues;
- architecture or boundary drift;
- dead code or duplicate wiring;
- naming or complexity regressions;
- observability and test-quality gaps that matter on the final diff.

#### Handling structured checker stalls

If the structured checker exceeds its budget before completing the full diff:

1. reduce the diff scope to the highest-risk modules identified during discovery;
2. skip non-critical checks that would not change the final verdict;
3. serialize remaining checks rather than running them concurrently.

Do not abandon the gate because a single checker stalled. Record any scope reductions or skipped checks in the readiness report.

### 4. Triage structured findings

Classify findings into:

- blocker
- fix-now
- follow-up
- not applicable

Do not treat every automated finding as truth. Ground them in the actual code and diff.

### 5. Run a final whole-diff review

After any structured findings are triaged:

1. run a final substantive review over the whole stable diff;
2. ask the reviewer to focus on:
   - correctness regressions;
   - cross-fix interaction bugs;
   - test sufficiency;
   - contract drift;
   - security issues the earlier loops missed.

### 6. Produce an explicit readiness verdict

End with one of these outcomes:

- ready for review
- ready with follow-ups
- not ready
- stopped by user

### 7. Report clearly

Summarize:

- blockers;
- fix-now items;
- follow-ups;
- skipped-check reason, if the diff was not code-bearing;
- final readiness verdict.

The result should make the next action obvious.

## Example Readiness Report

Use a durable report shape so the next actor can make a decision quickly. For example:

```text
Review surface: PR #128 against main
Structured checker: codex review + repo test suite
Blockers:
- Missing null-path coverage in src/api/createWidget.js
Fix-now:
- Rename duplicate option key in plugin.json example
Follow-ups:
- Consider extracting shared validation helper after merge
Skipped checks:
- None
Verdict:
- ready with follow-ups
```

## Required Gates

A final readiness pass is not complete until:

- the stable diff was evaluated as a whole;
- any structured findings were triaged when applicable;
- a final substantive review was performed;
- an explicit readiness verdict was produced.

## Stop Conditions

- the review surface is still changing materially;
- structured findings conflict and no human tie-breaker is available;
- required validation commands or comparison baseline are still unknown;
- the diff is too large to judge coherently without first reducing or chunking it;
- a structured checker stalls and scope reduction cannot recover the pass;
- the developer asks to stop.

Before stopping because a structured checker stalled or the diff exceeded the review budget, attempt at least one rescue: narrow to the highest-risk modules, skip non-critical checks, or serialize the remaining work. Stop only after the rescue fails or the developer confirms abandonment.

When a hard stop is necessary, report why the gate is not yet trustworthy, record the rescue attempt and its outcome, and resume only on a stable diff.
