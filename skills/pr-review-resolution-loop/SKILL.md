description: Resolve pull request review comments with disciplined triage, scoped fixes, thread closure, and final validation.
---

## Purpose

Use this skill when a developer wants to work through pull request or branch review feedback in a disciplined loop.

This skill is for review resolution, not first-pass implementation. It assumes there is already an active branch or review surface and a set of comments or threads to evaluate.

## When to Use It

Activate when the developer asks for things like:

- "work through the review comments"
- "decide which comments should actually be fixed"
- "address the review feedback and close the threads"
- "reply to the comments we are declining"

## Project-Specific Inputs

Before you start, identify:

- the active branch or review surface;
- where review comments and threads are collected;
- the repository's validation commands;
- how the team expects resolved comments to be replied to and closed;
- whether the repository allows parallel fix tracks or prefers serial review fixes.

## Default Roles

Use separate roles for:

- an implementer that makes accepted fixes;
- a reviewer that inspects each fix and the final integrated result.

## Core Rules

### 1. Do not assume every review comment is correct

Every review item must be triaged into one of these outcomes:

- fix
- decline
- clarify first

Never churn the code just to satisfy a weak, stale, or incorrect comment.

### 2. Accepted fixes still follow TDD and design rules

For comments that become fixes:

1. add or adjust failing tests first when behavior changes;
2. implement the smallest fix that resolves the issue;
3. refactor only while tests stay green.

### 3. Close the loop on every thread

Every review thread should end in one of these states:

- fixed and resolved;
- declined with a clear rationale;
- intentionally left open because a real blocker remains.

Do not stop with code changes only.

## Workflow

### 1. Gather review context

Before making changes:

1. collect open review threads and relevant general comments;
2. read the current code and nearby tests;
3. confirm the latest branch diff and validation status.

Do not act on comment text alone if the code has moved.

### 2. Triage review items

For each item, classify whether it is:

- a correctness issue;
- a security issue;
- a missing or weak test;
- a contract mismatch;
- an architecture concern;
- stale, already fixed, or out of scope.

Then decide whether to fix, decline, or clarify first.

### 3. Batch independent fixes when safe

If multiple accepted fixes are independent:

1. group them into separate fix tracks;
2. keep tightly coupled fixes serial;
3. reuse the implementation-loop rules for isolation, review, and cleanup.

If review items interact heavily, resolve them serially.

### 4. Implement each accepted fix

For every accepted fix:

1. give the implementer:
   - the exact review item;
   - the intended resolution;
   - the affected files;
   - the needed tests;
   - the scope boundary;
2. require minimal, focused changes only.

### 5. Review each fix

After each fix:

1. have a separate reviewer inspect the resulting diff;
2. ask for only substantive issues:
   - correctness regressions;
   - missing edge-case coverage;
   - contract drift;
   - security concerns;
   - material design regressions.

### 6. Reply to and resolve review threads

After each fix or decline:

- if fixed, reply briefly with what changed and resolve the thread;
- if declined, reply with the concrete reason and resolve it if appropriate;
- if clarification is still needed, post the question and leave the thread open intentionally.

Silent declines are not allowed.

### 7. Final validation

After all relevant review items are handled:

1. run the repository's real quality gates;
2. verify any new behavior has test coverage;
3. run the final PR-readiness workflow on the stable diff;
4. summarize remaining concerns, if any.

## Required Gates

### Comment gate

A comment is not complete until:

- it was triaged explicitly;
- fix, decline, or clarify-first was chosen;
- the thread was resolved or intentionally left open with a stated blocker.

### Fix gate

A fix is not complete until:

- tests changed first when applicable;
- the issue is actually resolved;
- review finds no unresolved substantive issue;
- touched files stay scoped to the real concern.

### Review batch gate

The batch is not complete until:

- all relevant review items are handled;
- repository validation passes;
- the final readiness workflow has been run;
- remaining issues are explicitly reported.
