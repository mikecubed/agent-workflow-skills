description: Run independent implementation tracks in parallel with disciplined review, merge, and validation gates.
---

## Purpose

Use this skill when a developer wants to implement a reviewed plan or task list with multiple parallel tracks without losing control of testing, integration, or review quality.

This is an execution skill, not a planning skill. Use it only after the feature already has accepted requirements, a plan, or an actionable task list.

## When to Use It

Activate when the developer asks for things like:

- "implement these tasks in parallel"
- "split this work into separate tracks"
- "have one model implement and another review each track"
- "parallelize the next ready tasks"

Also activate when:

- there are multiple dependency-ready tasks;
- the tasks touch different files or modules;
- the repository already has a documented validation path for the affected area.

## Project-Specific Inputs

Before you start, identify:

- the integration branch and final review target;
- the validation commands for each track;
- the repository's testing and quality gates;
- the approved branch, worktree, or sandbox strategy;
- any local rules for opening draft pull requests or track branches.

If any of those inputs are missing, stop and get them first.

## Default Roles

Use separate roles for:

- an **implementer** model or agent;
- a **reviewer** model or agent.

Keep implementation and review separate whenever possible.

In Claude Code, spawn each role as a separate agent using the Agent tool. Pass the implementer a scoped prompt with exact task, file, and TDD constraints. Pass the reviewer only the diff and the review criteria. Do not share context between roles.

### Escalation: Fleet / Agent Team Mode

If the active runtime offers a higher-cost orchestration mode such as a Fleet command or Claude Code agent teams, treat it as an explicit escalation path rather than the default execution mode.

Default to standard per-role agents first. Before escalating, explain why the extra coordination would help and ask the developer whether they want the higher-cost mode.

Escalate only when:

1. there are more than 2 clearly independent ready tracks;
2. each track has enough local context that repeated handoffs would be inefficient;
3. specialized sub-roles would materially improve throughput or review quality;
4. the developer confirms the extra token spend is worth it.

When team mode is approved:

- preserve the same role separation;
- assign one clear owner per track;
- keep reviewer authority independent from implementers;
- fall back to standard agents if coordination overhead becomes noisy or ambiguous.

### Model Selection

Resolve the active model for each role using this priority chain:

1. **Project config** — look for the runtime-specific config file in the current project root:
   - Copilot CLI: `.copilot/models.yaml`
   - Claude Code: `.claude/models.yaml`

   These are plain YAML files (no markdown, no fenced blocks). Read the `implementer` and `reviewer` keys directly. If a key is absent, fall back to the baked-in default for that role — do not re-prompt for a key that is missing.

2. **Session cache** — if models were already confirmed earlier in this session, reuse them without asking again.
3. **Baked-in defaults** — if neither config file nor session cache exists, show the defaults below, ask the user to confirm or override them once, then cache the answer for the rest of the session.

#### Config file format

The config files are plain YAML (not markdown). Create the file for the active runtime and set only the keys you want to override — absent keys fall back to the baked-in defaults. The keys for this skill are:

```yaml
implementer: <model-name>
reviewer: <model-name>
```

See `docs/models-config-template.md` in this plugin for ready-to-copy templates for both runtimes.

#### Default models

| Runtime       | Role        | Default model       |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Copilot CLI   | Implementer | `claude-opus-4.6`   |
| Copilot CLI   | Reviewer    | `gpt-5.4`           |
| Claude Code   | Implementer | `claude-opus-4.6`   |
| Claude Code   | Reviewer    | `claude-opus-4.6`   |

## Core Rules

### 1. Only parallelize truly independent work

Before launching tracks:

1. read the current tasks and dependency notes;
2. choose only tasks that are ready now;
3. group work by clear ownership boundaries;
4. serialize anything that touches the same tight code region, unstable contract, or unfinished prerequisite.

If in doubt, serialize.

### 2. TDD stays mandatory on every code-bearing track

Each implementation track must:

1. add or update failing tests first when behavior changes;
2. implement only enough to make the tests pass;
3. refactor while the tests remain green.

Do not allow implementation-first drift just because work is parallel.

### 3. Keep concurrency within human review capacity

Default to 2-3 concurrent tracks unless the repository already has strong task isolation,
independent validation paths, and a proven sandbox strategy such as dedicated worktrees.

More concurrency is only worth it when:

1. the track boundaries are obvious;
2. the validation surface for each track is small;
3. the final integrator can still review and merge each track deliberately.

### 4. Temporary work surfaces are disposable, not permanent state

If the workflow uses worktrees, branches, or other sandboxes (in Claude Code, use the Agent tool with `isolation: "worktree"` — it auto-cleans if no changes are made):

1. treat the integration branch as the long-lived review surface;
2. treat track work surfaces as temporary and batch-owned;
3. record, for each track:
   - track name;
   - owned task IDs;
   - owned files or modules;
   - validation commands;
   - current state (`active`, `merged`, `abandoned`, `blocked`);
4. do not silently discard dirty track state.

## Example Track Definition

Use a compact artifact format before launching each track. For example:

```text
Track: api-validation
Tasks: task-12, task-14
Files: src/api/validators.js, test/api/validators.test.js
Dependencies: task-11 done
Validation: npm test -- test/api/validators.test.js
Work surface: git worktree ../wt-api-validation
State: active
```

Persist the same fields in whatever task tracker, scratch file, or branch note the repository uses.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish the implementation baseline

Before launching tracks:

1. read the relevant requirements, plan, tasks, and nearby code;
2. identify the next ready tasks;
3. confirm the integration branch and final review target;
4. define track boundaries explicitly:
   - track name;
   - owned tasks;
   - owned files;
   - dependencies;
   - validation commands;
   - merge target.

### 2. Launch implementation tracks

For each track:

1. choose the execution mode:
   - standard scoped agents by default;
   - Fleet or agent-team mode only for explicitly approved, high-leverage tracks;
2. create an isolated work surface if the repository uses them;
3. provide the implementer with:
    - exact task IDs;
    - exact files or modules;
    - TDD expectations;
    - reuse constraints;
    - validation commands;
    - instruction to stay within scope;
4. require the track to report:
    - files changed;
    - tests added or updated;
    - validation performed;
    - uncertainties or blockers.

### 3. Review each completed track

After a track finishes:

1. send the diff to a separate reviewer;
2. ask for only substantive issues:
   - correctness bugs;
   - contract drift;
   - missing tests;
   - boundary violations;
   - duplication that materially matters.

Do not spend review budget on style-only nits.

### 4. Revise if needed

If the reviewer finds real issues:

1. send the issues back to the implementer;
2. rerun targeted validation;
3. re-review only if the changes were substantial.

Stop when the reviewer no longer finds meaningful issues.

### 5. Integrate tracks carefully

When tracks are ready:

1. merge them into the integration branch one at a time;
2. resolve cross-track conflicts explicitly;
3. run targeted integration validation after risky merges;
4. stop and reconcile immediately if two tracks drifted on a shared interface.

### 6. Final validation and cleanup

After all track work is integrated:

1. verify the integrated behavior is coherent;
2. run the repository's real quality gates;
3. invoke `/agent-workflow-skills:final-pr-readiness-gate` on the stable integrated diff;
4. retire clean temporary work surfaces;
5. keep any retained work surface only with an explicit reason.

### 7. Record the batch outcome

Before stopping, publish one durable batch summary that includes:

1. merged tracks;
2. retained or abandoned tracks;
3. validations run;
4. unresolved follow-ups.

Prefer a durable artifact over chat-only memory when the repository has a place for it.

## Required Gates

### Track gate

A track is not complete until:

- tests were added or updated first when applicable;
- track-local validation passes;
- changed files stayed within scope;
- review found no unresolved substantive issues.

### Batch gate

The batch is not complete until:

- all integrated work is coherent;
- repository quality gates pass;
- the final readiness workflow has run on the stable integrated diff;
- temporary work surfaces are cleaned up or explicitly retained.

## Stop Conditions

- review or fix churn continues without convergence;
- track boundaries prove false;
- required repository inputs are still unknown;
- the developer asks to stop.

When that happens, reduce concurrency and continue serially.
