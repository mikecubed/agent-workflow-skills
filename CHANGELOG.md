## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- new `swarm-orchestration` skill in `workflow-orchestration`: dynamic runtime topology selection (coordinator-worker, pipeline, wave/batch, hierarchical, mesh), SWARM.md shared knowledge base lifecycle (create → update → archive/delete), five-role model selection (coordinator, scout, domain, synthesizer, reviewer), three token budget modes (`minimal` / `standard` / `deep`), bounded convergence rounds, rescue policy, and durable swarm summary artifact gate
- `docs/competitor-comparison.md`: full feature comparison of `agent-orchestration` against Superpowers and GSD with eight mermaid diagrams (architecture, workflow, coverage matrix, gap analysis, auto-trigger behavior, installation experience, roadmap, plugin composition)
- `docs/swarm-orchestration.md`: swarm orchestration research reference with eight mermaid diagrams (five topologies, system-to-topology map, gap analysis, token cost curves, model selection decision tree, failure modes, proposed skill flow, decision guide)

### Changed

- bumped `workflow-orchestration` plugin, umbrella package, and all marketplace manifests to `0.6.0`
- broadened root `package.json` `files` allowlist from three specific doc entries to `docs/` so all current and future docs ship in the published package
- synced `workflow-orchestration` description across both marketplace manifests to include "swarm orchestration"

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- umbrella marketplace groundwork for `agent-orchestration`, including a companion `plugins/sdd-workflow/` bundle and a new `planning-orchestration` skill
- umbrella docs for marketplace overview, install guidance, and companion-plugin composition
- vendored `plugins/clean-code-codex/` as a third separate marketplace bundle with its current skills, scripts, command, agent, and hooks

### Changed

- renamed the root plugin identity from `agent-workflow-skills` to `workflow-orchestration`
- updated marketplace metadata to expose both `workflow-orchestration` and `sdd-workflow`
- moved `workflow-orchestration` into `plugins/workflow-orchestration/` and converted the repo root to umbrella-only marketplace, docs, and validation infrastructure
- bumped the shared package, plugin manifests, and marketplace metadata to `0.5.0`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- scout/discovery guidance, factual-brief handoffs, and cheap-model routing support across all three shared workflow skills
- progress-based rescue policies, bounded resend loops, convergence rules, and workflow outcome-measure recording
- stronger structural assertions in `test/plugin-layout.test.js` for required protocol language in each `SKILL.md`

### Changed

- promoted durable workflow artifacts from advisory guidance to required gate conditions and expanded `docs/workflow-artifact-templates.md` with state and outcome fields
- updated `docs/coordinator-subagent-recommendations.md` and `docs/skills-evaluation.md` to reflect the implemented throughput improvements and out-of-scope persistent-team guidance
- bumped the shared package, plugin manifests, and marketplace metadata to `0.4.0`
- stopped tracking `.sdd/` planning artifacts in git and added `.sdd/` to `.gitignore`

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- optional Fleet / Claude Code agent-team escalation guidance across the shared workflow skills, with explicit cost-aware opt-in instead of making team orchestration the default
- explicit Azure DevOps PR discussion guidance in the review-resolution workflow and artifact template

### Changed

- bumped the shared package, plugin manifests, and marketplace metadata to `0.3.0`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with repo-specific contributor guidance
- `CLAUDE.md` with Claude Code specific repository instructions
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and supporting test coverage for Claude marketplace packaging
- `docs/models-config-template.md` with ready-to-copy Copilot and Claude model override examples
- `docs/workflow-artifact-templates.md` with canonical templates for track reports, review-resolution summaries, and readiness reports
- `scripts/verify-runtime.mjs` and `npm run validate:runtime` for isolated Copilot install/list/uninstall and real plugin loading checks in both Copilot CLI and Claude Code
- stronger test coverage for manifest sync, required skill sections, and packaged artifact contents

### Changed

- strengthened the shared skill docs with examples, stop conditions, stronger TDD language, and per-role model selection guidance
- expanded `README.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with validation, packaging, and runtime-verification guidance
- updated `docs/skills-evaluation.md` to track completed and remaining recommendations
- aligned the shared package, plugin manifests, and marketplace metadata for the `0.2.0` release

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-18

  - `final-pr-readiness-gate`
- Copilot manifest, Claude manifest, marketplace metadata, and validation workflow
