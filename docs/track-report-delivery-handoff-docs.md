Track: handoff-docs
Tasks: T005, T006, T007, T008, T009
Files: plugins/workflow-orchestration/README.md, plugins/workflow-orchestration/skills/delivery-orchestration/SKILL.md, docs/track-report-delivery-handoff-docs.md
Dependencies: T003 must land on the integration branch before this track starts
Validation: npm --prefix plugins/workflow-orchestration test
Work surface: /home/mikecubed/projects/wt-delivery14-docs
State: review
Validation outcome: pass
Unresolved issues:
- none
Rescue history:
- review found docs-only diff handoff gap and missing executable coordinator-boundary coverage | broadened default review handoff to any non-empty diff and added targeted plugin-layout assertions for deflection and no-planning/no-release contract | closes substantive review gaps without expanding into release/version surfaces | resolved | 1
Next action: coordinator reviews completed handoff-docs track; merge into integration branch after approval
Revision rounds: 1
Summary: Added post-delivery handoff contracts (review → diff-review-orchestration, knowledge → knowledge-compound), deflection behavior documentation with examples, coordinator-shape boundary contract, updated README with delivery-orchestration in skill list and recommended delivery loop section. All changes scoped to SKILL.md and README.md within the workflow-orchestration plugin.
Follow-ups: version bumps, changelog, and marketplace metadata remain serialized on the integration branch for the release-closure track (T010-T012).
