# Knowledge Capture Foundation 1.3.0 Batch Report

## Discovery brief

Task summary: Add a reusable `knowledge-compound` skill, define a durable knowledge artifact contract, wire optional prior-learning reuse into planning and diff-review workflows, update docs and metadata, bump workflow-orchestration and umbrella versions to `1.3.0`, and complete the repo validation gates.
Task shape: multi-track-batch
Relevant files: `plugins/workflow-orchestration/docs/workflow-artifact-templates.md`, `plugins/workflow-orchestration/skills/knowledge-compound/SKILL.md`, `plugins/workflow-orchestration/skills/planning-orchestration/SKILL.md`, `plugins/workflow-orchestration/skills/diff-review-orchestration/SKILL.md`, `plugins/workflow-orchestration/test/plugin-layout.test.js`, `plugins/workflow-orchestration/README.md`, `plugins/workflow-orchestration/plugin.json`, `plugins/workflow-orchestration/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/workflow-orchestration/package.json`, `package.json`, `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`
Task boundaries: In scope = workflow skill, docs, metadata, and version changes for knowledge capture. Out of scope = committing `.sdd/`, persistent orchestration, mandatory global taxonomy, refresh or session-mining workflows, changed diff-review modes, or altered readiness-gate semantics.
Validation commands: `npm --prefix plugins/workflow-orchestration test`, `npm --prefix plugins/workflow-orchestration run validate:runtime`, `npm run validate:plugin`, `npm test`
