Files: plugins/workflow-orchestration/docs/workflow-defaults-contract.md, plugins/workflow-orchestration/docs/workflow-state-contract.md, plugins/workflow-orchestration/docs/session-md-schema.md
Dependencies: Uses the accepted `.sdd/workflow-defaults-state-foundation-1-6-r7k2m9q4/` spec, plan, and task list as read-only planning input; no dependency on workflow-adoption track output
Validation: npm --prefix plugins/workflow-orchestration test
Work surface: feat/workflow-defaults-contracts-1-6 @ /home/mikecubed/projects/wt-workflow-defaults-1-6-contracts
State: revision
Validation outcome: pass
Unresolved issues:
- none
Rescue history:
- coordinator rescue | background track showed no visible worktree progress | preserve schedule by taking direct ownership in the track worktree | active | 1
- reviewer path correction | session-md-schema.md still referenced .workflow/state.yaml in five places after the initial review | apply a bounded resend limited to canonical path fixes and rerun validation | resolved | 2
Next action: commit the review fix, then merge into the feature branch if no further issues remain
Revision rounds: 1
Summary: Draft the shared workflow defaults contract, the durable workflow-state contract, and the session-schema boundary update for milestone 1.6.0.
Follow-ups: Confirm the contract wording stays aligned with the workflow-adoption and product-doc tracks during integration.
